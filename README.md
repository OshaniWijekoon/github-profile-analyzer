# GitHub Profile Analyzer

## 📌 Project Description
GitHub Profile Analyzer is a web-based application developed using **React, TypeScript, and Vite** that allows users to analyze GitHub profiles using the **GitHub REST API**.  
The system fetches real-time data such as repositories, programming languages used, star counts, and user statistics, and visualizes them using charts.

This project was developed as an academic project to demonstrate **API integration, frontend development, data analysis, and visualization**.
